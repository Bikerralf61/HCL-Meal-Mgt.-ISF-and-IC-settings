HCL ... settings; primarily please use default pdf versions ! - Here, documents are given in WORD format,

    for easier translations,
    or if you wish to use parts of the text in a paper you are preparing
    or to suggest changes in the general pdf file

(( Feel free to use, this is OPEN SOURCE ))

Note 1: YOU are responsible to periodically read the English pdf original for eventual changes made: Important ones might need to be carried into your version, too

Note 2: Apologies that the word versions are often quite a patchwork of iunsertions and quick fixes (like putting an invisible white box over something and other little fun surprises... - the author is no pro at formatting, sorry)
