# HCL-Meal-Mgt.- - ISF-and-IC-settings

Well tuned profile ISF and meal management in Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) is essential ....  also for transitioning to Full Closed Loop (FCL) (see default branch "FCL-book-autoISF" in https://github.com/bernie4375/FCL-potential-autoISF-research-)

Disclaimer – Important to read and understand. - 

Authors are no medical professionals but T1 diabetics (or parents of a T1D child) who report their -limited - understanding and experience, in an effort to contribute to a growing body of knowledge, and to facilitate development of patient centered solutions. 
Nothing in this site is medical advice, but it is meant to stimulate patient-driven self-responsible re-search. Anything you try to conclude for yourself you do on own risk. This is by no means a medical product, but what is offered is a toolset for participating in development. 
Never copy what others report to use, but investigate and adjust to your data. Neglecting safety instructions, and just using the “buttons” that are made available in a supposed “learning by doing” mode, can be dangerous.

Please observe that a correct basal rate (that keeps you stable at iob and cob near zero in open loop) is a pre-requisite. Factors (ISF, IC) and other settings would be burdened extra, if they have to balance for basal errors, too.

Stay connected with your doctor/medical team. (Even if not knowing much about your DIY loop, they should be valueable experts in setting a correct basal, and also valueable consultants in other issues. 

Please also stay connected, and share experiences, with the DIY looper communities.
